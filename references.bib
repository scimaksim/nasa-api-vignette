	abstract = {The ongoing discoveries of extra-solar planets are unveiling a wide range of terrestrial mass (size) planets around their host stars. In this Letter, we present estimates of habitable zones (HZs) around stars with stellar effective temperatures in the range 2600 K--7200 K, for planetary masses between 0.1 M⊕ and 5 M⊕. Assuming H2O-(inner HZ) and CO2-(outer HZ) dominated atmospheres, and scaling the background N2 atmospheric pressure with the radius of the planet, our results indicate that larger planets have wider HZs than do smaller ones. Specifically, with the assumption that smaller planets will have less dense atmospheres, the inner edge of the HZ (runaway greenhouse limit) moves outward (∼10% lower than Earth flux) for low mass planets due to larger greenhouse effect arising from the increased H2O column depth. For larger planets, the H2O column depth is smaller, and higher temperatures are needed before water vapor completely dominates the outgoing longwave radiation. Hence the inner edge moves inward (∼7% higher than Earth's flux). The outer HZ changes little due to the competing effects of the greenhouse effect and an increase in albedo. New, three-dimensional climate model results from other groups are also summarized, and we argue that further, independent studies are needed to verify their predictions. Combined with our previous work, the results presented here provide refined estimates of HZs around main-sequence stars and provide a step toward a more comprehensive analysis of HZs.},

@article{geosciences9030105,
	abstract = {The discovery of only a handful of exoplanets required establishing a correlation between giant planet occurrence and metallicity of their host stars. More than 20 years have already passed from that discovery, however, many questions are still under lively debate: (1) What is the origin of that relation?; (2) What is the exact functional form of the giant planet&ndash;metallicity relation (in the metal-poor regime)?; and (3) Does such a relation exist for terrestrial planets? All of these questions are very important for our understanding of the formation and evolution of (exo)planets of different types around different types of stars and are the subject of the present manuscript. Besides making a comprehensive literature review about the role of metallicity on the formation of exoplanets, I also revisited most of the planet&ndash;metallicity related correlations reported in the literature using a large and homogeneous data provided by the SWEET-Cat catalog. This study led to several new results and conclusions, two of which I believe deserve to be highlighted in the abstract: (i) the hosts of sub-Jupiter mass planets (&sim;0.6&ndash;0.9 M♃) are systematically less metallic than the hosts of Jupiter-mass planets. This result might be related to the longer disk lifetime and the higher amount of planet building materials available at high metallicities, which allow a formation of more massive Jupiter-like planets; (ii) contrary to the previous claims, our data and results do not support the existence of a breakpoint planetary mass at 4 M♃ above and below which planet formation channels are different. However, the results also suggest that planets of the same (high) mass can be formed through different channels depending on the (disk) stellar mass i.e., environmental conditions.},
